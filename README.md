README: Voting App on Kubernetes

Overview
This README outlines the steps to deploy a voting application on a Kubernetes cluster. The application allows users to cast votes for different options.

Prerequisites
A Kubernetes cluster running on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) or on-premises.
Helm installed on your local machine.
A Git client (e.g., Git Bash, GitHub Desktop).
Steps
Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/rskelevra/rsk8srepository.git
cd voting-app/helm
Use code with caution.

Accessing the Application
Once the deployment is complete, you can access the voting application using the service URL provided by Helm. If you used a NodePort service, you can access the application using http://<your-node-ip>:<node-port>. If you used a LoadBalancer service, you can access the application using the external IP provided by your cloud provider.

Additional Considerations
Persistence: If your application requires persistent storage for voting data, you can use Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) in your Helm chart.
Ingress: If you need to expose the application to the internet, configure an Ingress resource in your Kubernetes cluster.
Monitoring: Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the application's performance and health.
Security: Consider security best practices, such as using network policies, limiting access to the application, and protecting sensitive data.
